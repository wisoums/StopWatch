StopWatchPro is a simple console-based application written in C# that simulates a basic stopwatch. The program allows users to start, 
stop, and measure elapsed time. It includes a menu-driven interface for user interaction, guiding users through available commands. 
The application handles and validates user inputs, ensuring smooth operation. It utilizes object-oriented programming principles 
to encapsulate the stopwatch functionality within a dedicated class, promoting modularity and ease of maintenance. Overall, StopWatchPro 
highlights key programming concepts such as user input handling, input validation, and time measurement.
